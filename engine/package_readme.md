# Package: seer_engine

**Location**: `engine` (src layout: `engine/src/seer_engine`)
**Last Updated**: 2026-10-03 (fill simulator P2, phase 4 of `ENGINE_FILL_SIMULATOR_PLAN.md`: `prices`, `sim`)

## Overview

`seer_engine` is Seer's Python data pipeline. It writes the Neon (Postgres) tables the web
app reads: daily bars, USD/IDR FX and nightly `runs`, plus the engine's own bookkeeping tables
(point-in-time `universe`, `split_adjustments`, `backfill_log`). Phase 1 is the foundation:
the package, a plug-in CLI, migration 002, NYSE date arithmetic, idempotent DB write helpers
and removal of the web app's seeded demo data. Later phases add commands on top of it
(`universe`, `backfill`, `nightly`).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- One CLI (`python -m seer_engine` / `seer-engine`) whose subcommands are discovered from `seer_engine/commands/`
- Config from the environment, with the repo-root `.env.local` as a local fallback
- One transaction helper that every write goes through, with a whole-run `--dry-run`
- NYSE session arithmetic: which session's data is complete (`data_date`) and which session the next picks are for (`session_date`)
- Idempotent upserts for `bars` and `fx_rates`, where an identical re-run changes 0 rows
- The `runs` row lifecycle: one real row per target session
- Purging demo rows before the first real write
- Applying `db/migrations/*.sql`, sharing `schema_migrations` with web's `db:migrate`
- The pure fill simulator (`sim/`): order lifecycle, whole-share sizing, cash/equity and split recompute, shared by the backtest (P3) and nightly paper trading (P4)

## CLI

```
python -m seer_engine [--version] [--dry-run] [-v|-vv] <command> [command args]
```

- `--dry-run`: runs every read and every write statement, then rolls back every transaction, so nothing persists.
- `-v`: debug logging. `-vv` also enables debug logging for the `urllib3`, `yfinance` and `peewee` loggers.
- The global flags work on either side of the command name. Documented usage puts them before it.
- Logs go to stderr with UTC ISO timestamps.

**Exit codes** (`cli.main`): 0 success or no-op; 1 an uncaught exception or a failed run; 2
`config.ConfigError` (missing setting) or an unmet precondition returned by a command; 130
Ctrl-C. Otherwise the code is whatever the command's `run()` returns.

### Command contract

Every public module in `seer_engine/commands/` (a name not starting with `_`) is a command:

```python
HELP: str
def add_arguments(p: argparse.ArgumentParser) -> None   # optional
def run(args: argparse.Namespace) -> int               # args.dry_run, args.verbose always set
```

To add a command, add a module. `cli.py` never changes. `discover()` raises `TypeError` if a
module has no callable `run`.

### Commands (phase 1)

| Command | Args | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `migrate` | `--dir PATH` (default `<repo>/db/migrations`) | Applies pending `*.sql` files in file-name order, one transaction per file, and records each in `schema_migrations(name, applied_at)`. It is the twin of `web/scripts/migrate.mjs` and uses the same table and key, so either runner can apply any file. Under `--dry-run`, all pending files are applied in one transaction (later files may depend on earlier ones), which is then rolled back, so not even `schema_migrations` is created. |

### `backfill` (phase 3, P1-ENG-L73U)

```
python -m seer_engine [--dry-run] backfill [--start YYYY-MM-DD] [--end YYYY-MM-DD]
    [--symbols AAPL,BRK.B] [--retry-failed] [--skip-fx | --fx-only] [--batch-size N]
```

A one-off, resumable history load: daily bars from yfinance plus USD/IDR history from Frankfurter.

- **Range**: `--start` defaults to `2015-01-02` (`DEFAULT_START`). `--end` defaults to `dates.last_completed_session(now UTC)`. Both bounds are inclusive. `--start` after `--end` is exit 2.
- **Symbols**: every symbol returned by `universe.all_symbols(conn, since=start)`, which includes SPY. An empty universe (nothing but SPY) is exit 2 with a hint to run `universe refresh` first. `--symbols` takes a comma list in place of the universe and ignores `backfill_log`. Yahoo dash spellings are converted to the dot form.
- **Resume**: by default, symbols already in `backfill_log` with any status (`ok`, `empty` or `failed`) are skipped and counted as "skipped". `--retry-failed` skips only `ok` and re-attempts `failed` and `empty`.
- **Batches**: `--batch-size` symbols per `yf.download` call (default 40, `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`), with a 3 s pause between batches (`BATCH_PAUSE_S`). A rate-limited call is retried after 60, 120 and 240 s (`RATE_LIMIT_BACKOFF_S`). After that, or on any other download exception, the whole batch is logged `failed` and the run continues. A symbol that comes back with no bars in range gets one individual retry, then is logged `empty`.
- **Writes**: each batch's `bars.upsert_bars` and its `backfill_log` upserts run in one `db.transaction`, so a crash loses at most one batch. `backfill_log` stores `status`, `first_date`, `last_date`, `rows` and `error` (cut to 500 characters). The log upsert never downgrades an `ok` row to `failed`, and it skips identical rows.
- **FX**: unless `--skip-fx`, `fx.fetch_range(start, end)` then `fx.upsert_fx` into `fx_rates`, in its own transaction after the bars. An FX fetch failure is reported, and the bars already committed are kept. `--fx-only` skips the bars entirely.
- **Order**: symbol selection (a read), then `demo.purge_demo_if_needed`, then the bars, then FX. No `runs` row is written, and no splits are recorded, because yfinance history is already adjusted for every split up to the moment the backfill runs. Later splits are applied by the nightly command.
- **Idempotent**: every write is an upsert. Re-running with the same arguments changes 0 `bars` and `fx_rates` rows.
- **Output**: a summary on stdout with ok, empty, failed and skipped counts, bar rows fetched and changed, the failed and empty symbol lists, FX rows changed, and the `bars` table size from `pg_total_relation_size`.
- **Exit codes**: 0 when everything succeeded (empty symbols are not a failure); 1 when any symbol failed or the FX fetch failed; 2 for a bad range or an empty universe (`BackfillError`).
- **Testing seams**: `backfill(conn, opts, *, downloader=None, sleep=time.sleep, fetch_fx=None) -> Summary` takes injectable network and sleep callables. `fetch_batch`, `select_symbols`, `options_from_args` and `format_summary` are also public.

## Exported API

### config

- `REPO_ROOT: Path`: the repository root, derived from the file's location.
- `class ConfigError(RuntimeError)`: raised when a required setting is missing. The CLI maps it to exit code 2.
- `env_file() -> Path`: `$SEER_ENV_FILE`, else `<repo>/.env.local`.
- `load_env() -> Path | None`: loads the dotenv file without overriding variables that are already set. Returns `None` when the file is absent (CI). Safe to call more than once.
- `get(name) -> str | None`: the value of `name`. Empty counts as unset. Calls `load_env()` on first use.
- `require(name) -> str`: like `get`, but raises `ConfigError` with the variable name and the dotenv path it checked.

### db

- `CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S = 15`
- `connect(url=None) -> psycopg.Connection`: opens a connection with autocommit off. Defaults to `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (Neon's direct endpoint, because the pooled one drops session state such as temp tables).
- `transaction(conn, dry_run: bool)`: a context manager. Commits on success. On any exception, including `BaseException`, it rolls back and re-raises. With `dry_run` it rolls back after the block completes.

### http

- `USER_AGENT = "seer-engine/0.1.0"`: set on the shared session. Wikipedia returns 403 to the default python-requests agent.
- `class HttpError(RuntimeError)`: has a `.status` attribute (`int | None`).
- `redact(url) -> str`: replaces the value of any `api_key`/`apikey`/`access_token`/`token`/`key` query parameter with `REDACTED`.
- `get_json(url, params=None, *, retries=3, backoff=5.0, timeout=30) -> dict`: GETs a JSON object. Connection errors, timeouts, 429 and 5xx responses are retried with exponential backoff (`backoff * 2**(n-1)`). A numeric `Retry-After` header wins when it is longer. Any other non-200 status, non-JSON body or non-object JSON raises `HttpError` at once. Every URL in logs and exception messages is redacted.

### dates

All dates are `datetime.date`. The only timezone-aware datetimes are the UTC "now" and NYSE closes.

- `CALENDAR = "NYSE"`, `DEFAULT_SETTLE = timedelta(hours=1)`
- `@dataclass(frozen) RunDates(data_date: date, session_date: date)`
- `sessions(start, end) -> list[date]`: inclusive, ascending. Returns `[]` when `end < start`.
- `is_session(d) -> bool`: half days count as sessions.
- `next_session(d)` / `prev_session(d) -> date`: strictly after or before `d`. Scans up to 3 years, then raises `ValueError`.
- `session_close_utc(d) -> datetime`: the scheduled close in UTC, accounting for half days and DST. Raises `ValueError` when `d` is not a session.
- `last_completed_session(now_utc, settle=DEFAULT_SETTLE) -> date`: the latest session whose close plus `settle` is at or before `now_utc`. Requires an aware datetime (`ValueError` otherwise).
- `run_dates(now_utc=None, settle=DEFAULT_SETTLE) -> RunDates`: `data_date = last_completed_session(now)` and `session_date = next_session(data_date)`.

Passing a `datetime` where a `date` is expected raises `TypeError`, because `datetime` is a `date` subclass and would otherwise slip through.

### prices

Pure value types for prices, with no database import, so the simulator can use `Bar` without loading `psycopg`. `bars` re-exports all three names, so `from seer_engine.bars import Bar, PRICE_QUANTUM, to_decimal` keeps working.

- `PRICE_QUANTUM = Decimal("0.0001")`
- `@dataclass(frozen, slots) Bar(symbol, date, open, high, low, close: Decimal, volume: int)`
- `to_decimal(x) -> Decimal`: rounds half-up to 4 dp. Floats go through `repr`, so `0.1` becomes `0.1000`. Raises on bool and non-finite values.
```

### bars

Prices are split-adjusted only (no dividend adjustment) and stored as `numeric(12,4)`. Volume is an `int`. Symbols use the canonical dot form (`BRK.B`).

- `PRICE_QUANTUM`, `Bar`, `to_decimal`: defined in `prices` and re-exported here unchanged.
- `to_volume(v) -> int`: rounds half-up. Raises on bool, non-finite and negative values. Massive reports volume as a float.
- `make_bar(symbol, d, o, h, l, c, v) -> Bar`: validates and rounds. Raises `ValueError` for an empty symbol and `TypeError` for a non-date or datetime `d`.
- `upsert_bars(conn, bars) -> int`: COPYs into the temp table `_seer_bars_in`, then runs `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (symbol, date) DO UPDATE ... WHERE ... IS DISTINCT FROM`. Returns the number of rows inserted or changed. An identical re-run returns 0 and creates no new row versions (`xmin` is unchanged). Raises `ValueError` when a batch holds the same `(symbol, date)` twice.
- `latest_bar_date(conn, symbol) -> date | None`
- `delete_bars_on(conn, d) -> int`

### fx

- `FRANKFURTER = "https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1"`, `PARAMS = {"base": "USD", "symbols": "IDR"}`. These are ECB reference rates and need no API key.
- `fetch_latest() -> (date, Decimal)`: the newest rate and the date Frankfurter assigns to it.
- `fetch_range(start, end) -> list[(date, Decimal)]`: inclusive and ascending, with one request per calendar year.
- `upsert_fx(conn, rows) -> int`: has the same temp-table and `IS DISTINCT FROM` shape as `upsert_bars` (`_seer_fx_in`). An identical re-run returns 0. Raises `ValueError` on conflicting rates for one date in a batch. A missing IDR rate in a response raises `ValueError`.

### yahoo (phase 3)

This is the only module that knows Yahoo's ticker spelling. Prices come from yfinance's `Open/High/Low/Close/Volume` with `auto_adjust=False`, so they are split-adjusted but not dividend-adjusted. `Adj Close` is ignored on purpose.

- `Downloader = Callable[[list[str], date, date], DataFrame | None]`: `(yahoo_tickers, start, end_exclusive)`. Tests inject a fake and never touch Yahoo.
- `class RateLimited(Exception)`
- `to_yahoo(symbol)` / `from_yahoo(ticker) -> str`: `BRK.B` and `BRK-B`, upper-cased and stripped.
- `yf_download(tickers, start, end_exclusive)`: the real downloader. One `yf.download` call (`interval="1d"`, `group_by="ticker"`, `threads=False`, `repair=False`). `yf.download` swallows per-ticker errors and only logs them, so a temporary handler on the `yfinance` logger captures ERROR records. A rate-limit message there, or a raised `YFRateLimitError`, raises `RateLimited`.
- `download(symbols, start, end_exclusive, *, downloader=None) -> dict[str, list[Bar]]`: one entry (possibly empty) per requested canonical symbol, with bars sorted by date. The caller filters to its inclusive range, because Yahoo can return a partial current-day bar.
- `parse_frame(frame, tickers)`: accepts `(Ticker, Price)` or `(Price, Ticker)` MultiIndex columns, and flat columns when exactly one ticker was requested.
- `frame_to_bars(symbol, sub) -> list[Bar]`: drops rows with missing or non-finite OHLC and rows with a non-positive price. A missing volume becomes 0. A tz-aware index is made naive without conversion, so the exchange-local date is kept.

### runs

- `MAX_ERROR_CHARS = 2000`
- `start_run(conn, rd: RunDates) -> int | None`: claims the real run row for `rd.session_date` and sets `status='running'`. Returns `None` when that session already has a successful real run, in which case the caller does nothing. A failed or stale running row is reused with the same id: error and `finished_at` are cleared and `data_date` is refreshed. This relies on the `runs_real_session_uidx` partial unique index.
- `finish_run(conn, run_id)`: sets `success` and `finished_at = clock_timestamp()`.
- `fail_run(conn, run_id, error)`: sets `failed` with a redacted error cut to 2000 characters.
- Both final setters raise `LookupError` when `run_id` is not a real (non-demo) run.

### universe (read side only; phase 2 writes the table)

Membership intervals are `[start_date, end_date)`, where `end_date` is exclusive and NULL means still a member.

- `BENCHMARK = "SPY"`
- `members_on(conn, d) -> set[str]`: symbols in either index (SP500 or NDX) on `d`.
- `symbols_for_bars(conn, d, grace_days=30) -> set[str]`: members on `d`, plus members that left within `grace_days` (so open positions keep a price), plus `BENCHMARK`.
- `all_symbols(conn, since) -> list[str]`: every symbol that was a member at any time after `since`, plus `BENCHMARK`, sorted.

### demo

Demo bars and FX rows look exactly like real ones, so the trigger is that a `runs` row with `is_demo` exists. While one exists, every row in the demo-owned tables is treated as demo data.

- `DEMO_TABLES = ("action_dismissals", "orders", "equity_snapshots", "bars", "fx_rates", "runs")`. `strategies` is kept on purpose.
- `has_demo(conn) -> bool`
- `purge_demo(conn) -> bool`: `TRUNCATE <DEMO_TABLES> RESTART IDENTITY` when demo data exists. Does not commit.
- `purge_demo_if_needed(conn, dry_run) -> bool`: runs `purge_demo` in its own `db.transaction`. Under `dry_run` the purge runs, is rolled back and logs "would purge". The return value still says whether it purged or would have.

### sim (fill simulator, P2)

Pure and deterministic: no database, no network, no clock, no randomness, no logging. It imports only `seer_engine.dates` and `seer_engine.prices`, never `bars`, and `tests/test_sim_purity.py` checks in a subprocess that `psycopg`, `requests` and `yfinance` stay out of `sys.modules`. Every value is a frozen dataclass, and every function returns new values. All money and prices are `Decimal`, quantized to 4 dp half-up (`q`). Shares are `int`. A float or any other non-`Decimal` price raises `TypeError`. Import everything from `seer_engine.sim`.

**Rules** (design §5 + handover §3, all tested on synthetic bars):

| Topic | Rule |
|---|---|
| Fill | session `low < limit` (strict; a touch does not fill). Fill at the **open** if `open < limit`, else at the limit. Fill session = day 1 |
| Unfilled | the pending order expires at the end of its session; the slot is free for that night's picks |
| Session order | (1) time stop at the open, (2) gap at the open (`open <= SL` → `gap`, then `open >= TP` → `tp`), (3) intraday `low <= SL` → `sl` at SL, then `high > TP` → `tp` at TP (SL first), (4) fills, (5) expiries, (6) mark to close. A position filled today is not checked against TP/SL today |
| Time stop | `days_held >= 5` and a bar → exit at that bar's open, reason `time`, before any gap/TP/SL check |
| `days_held` | fill session = 1; +1 for every later session survived, bar or not. Intraday exit on day k records k; an exit at the open of day k (time, gap, gap-TP) records k − 1, so a time exit records 5 |
| Costs | `buy_cost = q(price × shares × 1.001)`, `sell_proceeds = q(price × shares × 0.999)`. Fill: `cash -= buy_cost`; exit: `cash += sell_proceeds` |
| `pnl_usd` | `sell_proceeds − buy_cost`, so Σ `pnl_usd` reconciles with cash exactly. Within 0.0001 of handover §3's `(exit − fill) × sh − 0.001 × (exit + fill) × sh` |
| Equity | `q(cash + Σ shares × last known close)` at each session's close. Pending orders reserve nothing in equity |
| Sizing | picks in rank order; each placed pick takes the lowest free slot. `budget = min(q(equity / 4), cash − Σ buy_cost(limit, shares) of pending orders)`, with `equity` the last snapshot. `shares = floor(budget / (limit × 1.001))`. Rejections: `held` (symbol has a live order, or a duplicate pick), then `no_slot`, then `lt_one_share`. A rejection never uses a slot. 0 picks is valid |
| Missing bar | an open position without a bar: no event, the day still counts, marked at the last close. A due time stop waits for the next bar's open. A pending order without a bar expires |
| Holidays | the caller steps NYSE sessions only (`dates.sessions`). `step` raises on a non-session |
| Splits | `apply_split` rewrites live orders in post-split units (see below) |

**Constants and helpers** (`sim.model`):
- `SLOTS = 4`, `TIME_STOP_DAYS = 5`, `COST_RATE = Decimal("0.001")`
- `OrderStatus = Literal["pending", "open", "closed", "expired"]`, `ExitReason = Literal["tp", "sl", "time", "gap"]`, `EventKind = Literal["fill", "expire", "exit", "split"]`
- `q(x) -> Decimal`: quantize to `PRICE_QUANTUM`, half-up.
- `buy_cost(price, shares)`, `sell_proceeds(price, shares) -> Decimal`: as in the table.
- `initial_cash_usd(idr, usd_idr) -> Decimal`: `q(idr / usd_idr)`, with `usd_idr` the IDR price of 1 USD on the start date.

**Values:**
- `Order(session_date, slot, symbol, last_price, limit_price, tp_price, sl_price, shares, status="pending", fill_date=None, fill_price=None, days_held=0, exit_date=None, exit_price=None, exit_reason=None, pnl_usd=None)`: mirrors the `orders` columns except `strategy_id`, `company`, `explanation`, `id` and `created_at`. It validates itself: `slot` is 1–4, `shares >= 1`, `sl < tp`, the fill fields exactly when `open`/`closed`, and the exit fields exactly when `closed`.
- `Portfolio(cash, equity, orders=(), marks=(), last_session=None)`: one strategy's state between sessions.
  - `orders` holds **live** orders only (pending + open), sorted by slot, at most one per slot and one per symbol.
  - `marks` is `(symbol, last close)` for exactly the open symbols, sorted.
  - `equity` is the last snapshot's (or the initial cash).
  - Methods: `open_orders()`, `pending_orders()`, `free_slots()` (ascending), `held_symbols()` (all live, sorted), `mark(symbol)`.
- `new_portfolio(cash_usd) -> Portfolio`: `cash = equity = q(cash_usd)`.
- `Event(session_date, kind, order, forced=False, cash_usd=None)`:
  - `order` is the order state after the event. A terminal order (closed or expired) leaves the portfolio and appears only here, which is where P4 writes it.
  - `cash_usd` is the cash moved: `-buy_cost` on a fill, `+proceeds` on an exit, cash in lieu on a split, and `None` on an expire.
  - `forced=True` marks an exit made without a bar (`close_unpriced`, or a split that floors an open position to 0 shares).
- `Snapshot(date, cash_usd, equity_usd)`: one `equity_snapshots` row.
- `StepResult(portfolio, events, snapshot)`.

**Functions:**
- `step(portfolio, session_date, bars: Mapping[str, Bar]) -> StepResult` (`sim.lifecycle`): advances through one session.
  - `bars` holds split-adjusted bars keyed by symbol. Only bars for symbols with a live order are read and validated; the rest are ignored. A symbol absent from `bars` has no bar this session.
  - **Event order:** all exits in slot order, then all fills in slot order, then all expiries in slot order.
  - Raises `ValueError` when `session_date` is not an NYSE session, is not after `last_session`, or differs from a pending order's `session_date`, or when a bar has the wrong symbol or date. Raises `TypeError` on a non-`Bar` or a non-`Decimal` price.
- `close_unpriced(portfolio, symbols) -> (Portfolio, events)` (`sim.lifecycle`): force-closes open positions that will never get another bar (delisted, halted for good). Each exits at its mark, reason `time`, `exit_date = last_session`, with `forced=True`. It recomputes `equity`, so persist the snapshot after it. The caller decides that no bar will come; a pure step cannot know.
- `Pick(symbol, last_price, limit_price, tp_price, sl_price)` (`sim.sizing`): one ranked pick before sizing. It requires `sl < limit < tp`.
- `size_picks(portfolio, picks, session_date) -> SizingResult(portfolio, placed, rejected)` (`sim.sizing`): sizes the picks for the next session.
  - `placed: tuple[Order, ...]` and `rejected: tuple[Rejection(symbol, reason), ...]` are in pick order. `RejectReason = Literal["no_slot", "held", "lt_one_share"]`.
  - Cash does not change; a pending order pays at its fill.
  - Raises `ValueError` when `session_date` is not a session after `last_session`, or when a pending order for another session is still in the portfolio (step that session first).
- `apply_split(portfolio, symbol, factor, session_date) -> (Portfolio, events)` (`sim.split_adjust`):
  - `factor = split_to / split_from`, the same number as `splits.Split.factor`. 10 is a 10-for-1; `Decimal(1) / 32` is a 1-for-32 reverse split.
  - Call it once per split, after session S−1's `step` and before stepping the execution session S, with `session_date = S`.
  - Prices become `q(p / factor)`, and `shares = floor(shares × factor)`. The open position's fractional remainder is paid as cash in lieu at the adjusted mark, with no cost and outside `pnl_usd`; the amount is on the `split` event's `cash_usd`.
  - A pending order that floors to 0 shares emits `expire`. An open position that floors to 0 is paid out in lieu, emitting a forced `exit` (reason `time`, `pnl_usd = in lieu − buy_cost`).
  - Events are in slot order. `equity` stays at the last snapshot until the next `step` (unlike `close_unpriced`, which recomputes it). The caller applies each split exactly once (`split_adjustments` guarantees this).
  - Raises `ValueError` when a rescaled price or mark rounds to 0 at 4 dp, or SL rounds up to TP, and leaves the input untouched. Real listed stocks never get there.
  - P3 does not need it: backfilled history is already adjusted backwards.

**Determinism:** the same inputs give `==` and `repr`-identical events and snapshots. The insertion order of `bars` does not matter. `tests/test_sim_scenario.py` checks this, and also holds the 12-session hand-checked scenario.

## Migration 002 (`db/migrations/002_engine.sql`)

This migration is additive only. It is written by the engine, and web does not read these tables.

- `universe(symbol, index_id IN ('SP500','NDX'), start_date, end_date NULL, source_symbol)`, with PK `(index_id, symbol, start_date)`, `CHECK end_date > start_date` and an index on `symbol`. When an interval spans a rename, `source_symbol` joins the source tickers with `/`, oldest first (`FB/META`).
- `split_adjustments(symbol, execution_date, split_from > 0, split_to > 0, applied, recorded_at)`, with PK `(symbol, execution_date)`.
- `backfill_log(symbol PK, status IN ('ok','empty','failed'), first_date, last_date, rows, error, updated_at)`.
- `runs_real_session_uidx`: a unique index on `runs(session_date) WHERE NOT is_demo`, which allows at most one real run per session.

## Data Flow

Phase 1 provides the building blocks. Write commands in later phases use them in this order:

1. `cli.main` calls `config.load_env()`, builds the parser from `discover()`, sets up logging and calls the command's `run(args)`.
2. `run` opens `closing(db.connect())`. It does not use `with connect()`, because psycopg's connection context manager commits on exit.
3. `demo.purge_demo_if_needed(conn, args.dry_run)` runs in its own transaction before any other write.
4. Reads (`dates.run_dates`, `universe.*`, `http.get_json` / `fx.fetch_*`) are followed by writes (`bars.upsert_bars`, `fx.upsert_fx`, `runs.*`) inside `with db.transaction(conn, args.dry_run):`.
5. The transaction commits, or rolls back and re-raises. `main` maps exceptions to exit codes.

## Dependencies

### External
- `psycopg[binary]>=3.2`: the Postgres driver, used for COPY into temp tables in the upserts.
- `pandas>=2.2`, `pandas_market_calendars>=5.0`: the NYSE schedule, including closes, half days and DST.
- `requests>=2.32`: HTTP, through one module-level `Session` in `http.py`.
- `python-dotenv>=1.0`: parses `.env.local`. The file is parsed, never `source`d, because it contains an unquoted `&`.
- `yfinance>=1.0`: used only by `yahoo.py` (phase 3 backfill), imported lazily inside `yf_download`.
- dev: `pytest>=8`.

### Internal module graph
- `cli` imports `config` and `commands`. `commands.migrate` imports `config` and `db`.
- `db` imports `config`. `demo` imports `db`.
- `prices` imports only the standard library; `bars` imports `prices` and re-exports it. `fx` imports `http` and `bars.to_decimal`. `runs` imports `dates.RunDates` and `http.redact`.
- `http` imports `__version__` for `USER_AGENT`.
- `yahoo` imports `bars` and pandas. `commands.backfill` imports `bars`, `dates`, `db`, `demo`, `fx`, `universe` and `yahoo`.
- `sim.model` imports `prices`. `sim.lifecycle` and `sim.split_adjust` import `dates`, `prices` and `sim.model`. `sim.sizing` imports `dates` and `sim.model`. Nothing in `sim` imports `bars`, `db` or `http`.

### Standard library
`argparse`, `importlib`/`pkgutil` (command discovery), `logging`, `contextlib`, `dataclasses`, `decimal`, `functools.lru_cache`, `re`, `time`.

## Reverse Dependencies

- Within `engine/`, the phase 2 to 4 modules consume the API above exactly as written in the plan's "Shared interface contract": `membership.py` and `commands/universe.py` (phase 2), `yahoo.py` and `commands/backfill.py` (phase 3), and `massive.py`, `splits.py` and `commands/nightly.py` (phase 4).
- Phase 5 will add `.github/workflows/{engine-ci,nightly,universe,backfill}.yml`, which invoke the CLI.
- Nothing in `web/` imports the engine. The two share only the database schema and `schema_migrations`.

## Concurrency

This package is not designed for concurrent use. It is single-threaded and uses one connection per command. Some state is held per process:
- `http._session` is a module-level `requests.Session`.
- `config._loaded` is a module-level flag.
- `dates._calendar`, `_year` and `_closes` are `lru_cache`d per process.

The temp tables `_seer_bars_in` and `_seer_fx_in` are scoped to a session (`ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS`), so concurrent processes do not collide.

## Error Handling

- Custom exceptions: `config.ConfigError` (exit 2) and `http.HttpError(.status)`.
- Validation errors are `ValueError` or `TypeError` with a message naming the bad value or date.
- `runs` raises `LookupError` for an unknown or demo run id.
- `db.transaction` always re-raises after rolling back. Data helpers never commit.
- Secrets are redacted from every logged or raised URL and from `runs.error`.
- Nothing in the package panics or exits outside `cli.main`.

## Performance

- Bulk writes use COPY into a temp table and then one set-based `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`. Writes that change nothing are skipped by the `IS DISTINCT FROM` guard, so re-runs cause no table bloat.
- The NYSE schedule is computed once per year and cached for the life of the process.
- Network calls are the expensive part. `get_json` waits 5 s, then 10 s, then 20 s between retries by default. `fx.fetch_range` makes one request per year.
- Simulator: `tests/test_sim_scenario.py::test_benchmark_2950_sessions_x_4_slots` runs 2,950 NYSE sessions (2015-01-02 onward) × 4 slots with `size_picks` + `step` every session on synthetic bars, using `Decimal` throughout. Measured: **0.20 s** on WSL2, Python 3.11 (bound in the test: 20 s). A 10-year backtest is therefore dominated by loading bars and computing signals, not by the simulator. Floats are not needed.
- There is no benchmark coverage for the DB writers.

## Usage

### Setup and tests

```
python3.11 -m venv engine/.venv
engine/.venv/bin/pip install -e 'engine[dev]'
docker run -d --name seer-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pg -p 55432:5432 postgres:16
export PG_TEST_URL=postgresql://postgres:pg@localhost:55432/postgres
engine/.venv/bin/pytest engine/tests
```

DB tests skip without `PG_TEST_URL`, and CI should treat skips as failures. Each DB test gets
a throwaway schema `t_<hex>`. The fixtures are `pg` (migrated), `pg_empty`, `pg_schema`,
`pg_url` and `utc(y, m, d, h=0, mi=0)`. An autouse `_isolated_env` fixture points
`SEER_ENV_FILE` at a missing file and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` at a `.invalid` host, so no test
can reach `.env.local` or Neon.

### Settings
- `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`: required by `db.connect()`.
- `SEER_ENV_FILE`: optional override for the dotenv path.

### Typical write command

```python
def run(args):
    with closing(db.connect()) as conn:
        demo.purge_demo_if_needed(conn, args.dry_run)
        rd = dates.run_dates()
        with db.transaction(conn, args.dry_run):
            run_id = runs.start_run(conn, rd)
            if run_id is None:
                return 0
            bars.upsert_bars(conn, fetched)
            runs.finish_run(conn, run_id)
    return 0
```

### Simulator: P3 backtest loop

History is already split-adjusted backwards, so the backtest never calls `apply_split`.

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from seer_engine import dates
from seer_engine.sim import (
    Snapshot, close_unpriced, initial_cash_usd, new_portfolio, size_picks, step,
)

pf = new_portfolio(initial_cash_usd(Decimal("20000000"), usd_idr_on(start)))
events, snapshots = [], []
for session in dates.sessions(start, end):
    picks = strategy.picks(data_date=dates.prev_session(session))  # ranked Picks, made after that close
    pf = size_picks(pf, picks, session).portfolio
    result = step(pf, session, bars_on(session, pf.held_symbols()))  # {symbol: Bar}; missing = no bar
    pf = result.portfolio
    events += result.events
    snapshots.append(result.snapshot)
    gone = delisted_after(session, pf.open_orders())  # P3 knows from data when a symbol's bars end
    if gone:
        pf, forced = close_unpriced(pf, gone)
        events += forced
        snapshots[-1] = Snapshot(session, pf.cash, pf.equity)
```

### Simulator: P4 nightly

One strategy, one night: `rd = dates.run_dates()`. The session to settle is `rd.data_date`, and the picks are for `rd.session_date`.

```python
pf = load_portfolio(conn, strategy_id)
# Portfolio(cash, equity) from the last equity_snapshots row; orders = rows with status
# pending/open, sorted by slot; marks = last close per open symbol; last_session = last snapshot date.
# The marks must be in the same (pre-split) units as the orders: take them from closes as they were
# before splits.apply rescaled history, or apply_split would rescale an already-adjusted mark.
for split in splits_executing_on(conn, rd.data_date):        # recorded by splits.apply this run
    pf, split_events = apply_split(pf, split.symbol, split.factor, rd.data_date)
    persist_events(conn, strategy_id, split_events)            # UPDATE orders prices/shares; cash in lieu
result = step(pf, rd.data_date, bars_on(conn, rd.data_date, pf.held_symbols()))
persist_events(conn, strategy_id, result.events)              # fill/exit/expire -> UPDATE orders
persist_snapshot(conn, strategy_id, result.snapshot)          # equity_snapshots (strategy_id, date)
sized = size_picks(result.portfolio, ranked_picks, rd.session_date)
insert_orders(conn, strategy_id, sized.placed)                # status 'pending', slot 1..4
```

`Event.order` maps 1:1 onto `orders` columns. Its row key is `(strategy_id, order.session_date, order.symbol)`. Everything runs inside one `db.transaction`, so a failed night leaves nothing half-written.

### Gotchas
- Do not use `with psycopg.connect(...) as conn`, because it commits on exit and defeats `--dry-run`. Use `contextlib.closing` instead.
- Every write must be inside `db.transaction(conn, dry_run)`. The helpers never commit, so a write outside it is lost or left open.
- `demo.purge_demo_if_needed` must run before the first write. Any demo `runs` row means `bars` and `fx_rates` will be TRUNCATEd.
- Never build a local-midnight datetime from a date. Pass `date` objects, and give `last_completed_session`/`run_dates` an aware UTC datetime.
- Convert symbols to Yahoo's dash form (`BRK-B`) only inside the Yahoo adapter (phase 3). Tables always store `BRK.B`.
- `universe.end_date` is exclusive.
- Under `--dry-run`, `migrate` reports the files it would apply, but leaves no `schema_migrations` table behind.
